[Introduction]

  Hello.  Well the time has come that Renegade become a
bit more customizable than it has been in the past.  There
are numerous reasons why, though the best one is that it
allows the SysOp to customize his/her BBS to his/her
liking.

  The concept behind it all is actually -very- simple,
though I wouldnt expect anyone just to "catch on" as
quickly as others.  For this reason, I have decided NOT
to implement this feature in the Y2K "hotfix."

  Though, I would like to fore-warn you, that you should
expect this system to be implemented in the next version
of Renegade.  I will of course release the next version
with a default ENGLISH.LNG file (mentioned below), though
it will be just that "default."  It will make your current
"strings" in the System Configuration (under String Editor)
null/void.  So while becoming familiar with this new -way-,
I would highly suggest that you copy down what your strings
are now.  This goes two fold for those who use ANSI codes
in there strings.

  Now, if you are done reading my gibberish, I will be done
typing and go on to the use of it all.


[Usage]

  The usage is quite simple.  Please find time to read the
enclosed ENGLISH.LNG file which contains and exact (but
shortned) example of how the language templates will look.
Though for the sake of this short documentation, I will copy
those things found in the ENGLISH.LNG file and comment
some lines so that you may better understand, if not already.

  First, take notice of the semi-colons and their placement.
A line that begins with a semi-colon is a REMARK.  It serves
no purpose other than to allow the SysOp what he/she is
editing.

; 001  [= Anonymous =]

  This line is a comment, again, due to the preceeding
semi-colon.  This particular line is telling me:

001                 is the line number
[= Anonymous =]     is the description of the string itself


Now below the line that reads:

; 001  [= Anonymous =]



We have a funny looking string.  If you notice this is the 
ACTUAL string or what is displayed to the user.  Should look 
familiar to you:

|09[= |10Anonymous |09]



See how this works?

Extensive documentation will be provided, describing what line
number affects what string, in the next release that implements
this new system.  Dont be concerned about it right yet.


As I mentioned, this is the short documentation.  Its only purpose
is to enable the SysOp to become familiar with the soon to be
implemented language system.

Just to clear up something.  These files can be used for languages
or they can be used for making a BBS the biggest ANSi warez d00dz
BBS on the block.  Entirely up to the SysOp of course.



I will close this doc for now.  If there are any questions or
suggestions, please dont hesitate to email me.  Keep in mind
that if I do NOT reply to your email within a certain time frame
(for most that is a day) do NOT think I am ignoring you.  I keep
EVERY single email I receive.  Those that I received and have
not replied to get placed in a special folder so that I can
keep track of them all.  Remember, if I take awhile to reply
it is 99% likely I am working hard on the Renegade code.


At any rate.  Take care, and have fun.....
